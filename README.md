A simple web app to create custom quizzes from a user-supplied JSON file. Perfect for reviewing concepts or testing your knowledge quickly and interactively.

## üöÄ Features
The application is divided into two main sections:

**1\. Quiz Player (index.html)**

* **Multiple File Upload**: Load one or more JSON files to merge questions into a single quiz.  
* **Question Selection**: Choose how many questions to include in the test (5, 10, 20, or all).  
* **Randomization**: Both the questions and the order of the answers are shuffled in each session for a new experience every time.  
* **Instant Feedback**: Receive immediate feedback after each answer, complete with a detailed explanation.

**2\. Quiz Editor (editor.html)**

* **Create from Scratch**: Use a dedicated form to create new questions, defining the text, four answer options, the correct answer, and an explanation.  
* **Edit Existing Quizzes**: Upload your JSON files to edit, correct, or delete existing questions.  
* **Search and Filter**: Quickly find the questions you need by searching for keywords or filtering by the correct answer (A, B, C, D).  
* **Intuitive Interface**: Expand each question to view its details (answers and explanation) in a clear and readable format.  
* **Custom Download**: Download the complete set of questions as a single JSON file, with the option to give the file a custom name.

## üìÅ JSON File Format

The JSON file must contain a list of questions in the following structure:

```json
{  
    "questions": [  
        {  
            "id": 1,  
            "question_text": "Question text goes here...",  
            "options": [  
                { "id": "A", "text": "Option A" },  
                { "id": "B", "text": "Option B" },  
                { "id": "C", "text": "Option C" },  
                { "id": "D", "text": "Option D" }  
            ],  
            "correct_option_id": "C",  
            "explanation": "A brief explanation of the correct answer."
